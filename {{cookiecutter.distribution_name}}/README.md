{{ cookiecutter.description }}

<!--
  The README is this package's charter, and it is read in two places: on the
  repository page and on the package index. Write it for someone deciding
  whether to install this, who has not read anything else here.

  Every link is absolute. A relative link resolves on GitHub and 404s on PyPI,
  which is where the person deciding is most likely to be standing.

  The badge row above is the standard set for a published package: one status
  badge per workflow that runs on a push or a pull request, then coverage, the
  PyPI version, supported Python and Django, and the licence. A workflow added
  later gets its badge in the same row. The PyPI badges read "not found" until
  the first release, and the GitHub ones need the repository to be public.

  Sections, in this order:
    1. One sentence, above. What it does, for whom.
    2. Scope & philosophy — below. What it is and is not, and the principles
       that settle a close call.
    3. Installation.
    4. Quickstart — the smallest thing that works, end to end.
    5. The public surface, in full. For a package this small, list it.
    6. Anything genuinely surprising: what it deliberately does not do, what it
       leaves to the host project, and the failure modes that are quiet.

  Keep the CHANGELOG out of it. Link to it instead.
-->

## Scope & philosophy

<!--
  What this package is for, what it stays out of, and how a close call gets
  settled. Three short paragraphs at most.

  The useful sentences are the exclusions: "it renders markup and nothing else
  — no models, no views, no URLs" saves a reader the ten minutes they would
  otherwise spend finding out. Then the tension-breaker: when two reasonable
  designs conflict, which value wins here.

  This section and GOALS.md do different jobs. This one says what the package
  *is*; GOALS.md says what it is trying to become good at.
-->

## Installation

```bash
pip install {{ cookiecutter.distribution_name }}
```

Then add it to `INSTALLED_APPS`, after `mvp`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "mvp",
    "{{ cookiecutter.import_name }}",
]
```

This package requires [django-mvp](https://github.com/django-mvp/django-mvp).
It renders inside django-mvp's layout and reads its colours from the theme
django-mvp supplies, so it does nothing useful on its own.

## Quickstart

<!--
  The smallest complete example: what goes in the view, what goes in the
  template, and what appears on the page. Real code that runs, not a sketch.
  If the example needs three files, show three files.
-->

## Public surface

<!--
  Everything a host project can touch: components and their attributes,
  settings, template tags, models, views. Being able to list it exhaustively is
  a feature of a package this size, and the list is what makes an addition to
  it a deliberate decision rather than a side effect.
